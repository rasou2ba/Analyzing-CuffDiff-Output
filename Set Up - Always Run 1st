#Below code must be run to "activate" the CuffDiff output. Here you are making an object (called "cuff") that will be refered to by the other code
#Make sure the R working directory is in a folder with all gene summary files 1-6 and the "cuffData" data base file. All these files should be in the "cuffdiff_out" folder that the Tuxedo Protocol Ouputs.

#Set the value "cuff" to read the "cuffData" data base file. Cuff will give you a simple read out of what is in the database such as the number of samples, number of genes and isoforms.
#If you get zero samples or zero genes, this means the data was not found (likely because your working directory is incorrect)
